LPN-title=Create a Platform network :\n[item=ptflog-requester] act as [item=requester-chest].\n[item=ptflog-provider] act as [item=passive-provider-chest].\n[item=space-platform-hub] act as [item=logistic-robot].\n\nDefine request in [item=ptflog-requester] (section or by circuitry).\n[item=ptflog-provider] define providing item by read green and red signal.\nPlatform are auto-scheduled to get items in [item=ptflog-provider] and then deposit to the [item=ptflog-requester].\n[img=utility/warning_icon]In the [item=ptflog-requester] if a section contain [virtual-signal=signal-no-entry], the section are not handled by the network.
LPN-tat-1=LPN works with channel.\nEach channel works individualy. By default the "DEFAULT" channel is created.\nA new channel can be created in [item=ptflog-provider]/[item=ptflog-requester]/[item=space-platform-hub] GUI.\nBy default new [item=ptflog-provider]/[item=ptflog-requester]/[item=space-platform-hub] are assign to the "DEFAULT" channel.\nYou can assign a new channel in their GUI.\n 1. The current channel\n 2. Select and set entity on new channel\n 3.Create a new channel
LPN-tat-2=To fullfill request the scedule of [item=space-platform-hub] are auto-set and always the same.\nA custom section with the format "LPN : Platform n° :" is created and contains all items requested for this platform.\nWait conditions at [item=ptflog-provider] station :\n    -Unloading enabled(so be careful)\n    -All requests satisfied\n    -[virtual-signal=signal-green] = 1 (so you can make some circuitry if you want)\nWait conditions at [item=ptflog-requester] station :\n    -Unloading enabled(of course)\n    -Inactivity = 5s\n    -[virtual-signal=signal-green] = 1 (so you can make some circuitry if you want)\n    -when arriving at station : [item=space-platform-hub] section is update with all item at 0 and for all items item = 0
